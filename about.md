[Topical Activity Groups](https://euromathsoc.org/EMS-TAGs) of [European Mathematical Society](https://euromathsoc.org/) (EMS) are "intended to address the fragmentation of the European mathematical community and to foster the integration of scientific cooperation across all of Europe and all mathematical fields". In particualr, an EMS-TAG shall organize meetings and workshops, apply for support from the EMS for workshops or meetings through the usual procedures of the EMS, nominate candidates for EMS committee members and speakers for conferences, and shall plan and organize applications to European funding programs.

First Topical Activity Groups were formed in 2023 and we are praud to be one of them.
