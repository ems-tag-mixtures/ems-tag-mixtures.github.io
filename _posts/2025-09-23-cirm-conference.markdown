Dear colleagues,

let me share a good news with you. Thanks to the effort of Clement Cances, Virginie Ehrlacher, Patrick Farrell, Maria Lukacova, Gabriella Puppo and Christian Rohde, the next conference of TAG Mixtures will take place at the [CIRM](https://www.cirm-math.com/) (Marseille, France) from November 30 to December 4, 2026. The title of the conference is "MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR MIXTURES".

If you would like to add a minisymposium, school, or any other type of event to the list of TAG activities, please inform Vit Prusa ([prusv@karlin.mff.cuni.cz](mailto:prusv@karlin.mff.cuni.cz)) and me ([malek@karlin.mff.cuni.cz](mailto:malek@karlin.mff.cuni.cz)). The existing mailing list (thanks to Virginie!) can be used to circulate information about these events and to reach out to potential participants.

Best wishes, 
Josef Malek
